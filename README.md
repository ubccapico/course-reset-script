# Canvas "Course Reset" Script

- A Canvas API Token
- The course ID of the course you are resetting
--for example: for https://ubc.instructure.com/courses/1326, 1326 is the course id
## How to use the script:
1. Download the "Course Reset.py" script
2. Open the script using Python 3 IDLE
3. Run the script
4. You will be prompted to enter the course id of your course in the console of the IDLE
5. Enter "y" to continue
6. The script is complete once you see a "Done" message on the console
